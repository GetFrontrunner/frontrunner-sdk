Problem:
1. how to find market
2. how to go from probability to orders 
3. 2-3 states market to orders
4. send orders

what can you do with sdk
1. Supported data sources
2. Functions and what do they do
3. Update granter balance
4. Better data structure

Plan:
1. go over the repo, and try to simplify the structure (verify the Authz)
2. Make it easier to use, drop the local orderhash computation.
3. update open orders with info from chain, no need to track it locally

# Introduction

[Frontrunner][frontrunner] is the first zero gas fee, decentralized sports prediction market built on blockchain where you get the best odds with no house edge. Frontrunner is powered by [Injective][injective], a blockchain built for Web3 finance applications. This SDK offers a programmatic way to interact with both, powering use cases such as market making.
